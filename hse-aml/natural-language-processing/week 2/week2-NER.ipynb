Markup with the prefix scheme is called *BIO markup*. This markup is introduced for distinguishing of consequent entities with similar types.\n","\n","A solution of the task will be based on neural networks, particularly, on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTMs).\n","\n","### Libraries\n","\n","For this task you will need the following libraries:\n"," - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) — an open-source software library for Machine Intelligence.\n"," - [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) — a package for scientific computing.\n"," \n","If you have never worked with Tensorflow, you would probably need to read some tutorials during your work on this assignment, e.g. [this one](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent) could be a good starting point.

Definately, we can say so. Nowadays, Bi-LSTM is one of the state of the art approaches for solving NER problem and it outperforms other classical methods. Despite the fact that we used small training corpora (in comparison with usual sizes of corpora in Deep Learning), our results are quite good. In addition, in this task there are many possible named entities and for some of them we have only several dozens of trainig examples, which is definately small. However, the implemented model outperforms classical CRFs for this task. Even better results could be obtained by some combinations of several types of methods, e.g. see [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01354) paper if you are interested."]}]}
